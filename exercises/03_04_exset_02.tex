{, a matrix \ttm\ and det(\ttm) are given. Matrices \tta, \ttb\ and \ttc\ are formed by performing operations on \ttm. Determine the determinants of \tta, \ttb\ and \ttc\ using Theorems 
\ref{thm:determinant_row_operations} and \ref{thm:determinant_properties},
% 10 and 11,
  and indicate the operations used to form \tta, \ttb\ and \ttc.}
