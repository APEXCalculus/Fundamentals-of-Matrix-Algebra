{In a football game, 29 points are scored from 8 scoring occasions. There are 2 more successful extra point kicks than successful two point conversions. Find all ways in which the points may have been scored in this game.}
{The augmented matrix from this system is $\bmx{ccccc}1&1&1&1&8\\6&1&2&3&29\\0&1&-1&0&2\\ \emx$. From this we find the solution \begin{align*} t&=4-\frac13f\\ x&=3-\frac13f\\ w&=1-\frac13f.\end{align*} The only time each of these variables are nonnegative integers is when $f=0$ or $f=3$. If $f=0$, then we have 4 touchdowns, 3 extra points and 1 two point conversions (no field goals). If $f=3$, then we have 3 touchdowns, 2 extra points and no two point conversions (and 3 field goals). }
