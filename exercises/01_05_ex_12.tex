{In a football game, 24 points are scored from 8 scoring occasions. The number of successful extra point kicks is equal to the number of successful two point conversions. Find all ways in which the points may have been scored in this game.}
{The augmented matrix from this system is $\bmx{ccccc}1&1&1&1&8\\6&1&2&3&24\\0&1&-1&0&0\\ \emx$. From this we find the solution \begin{align*} t&=\frac83-\frac13f\\ x&=\frac83-\frac13f\\ w&=\frac83-\frac13f.\end{align*} The only time each of these variables are nonnegative integers is when $f=2$ or $f=8$. If $f=2$, then we have 2 touchdowns, 2 extra points and 2 two point conversions (and 2 field goals); this doesn't make sense since the extra points and two point conversions follow touchdowns. If $f=8$, then we have no touchdowns, extra points or two point conversions (just 8 field goals). This is the only solution; all points were scored from field goals.}
