{In a basketball game, where points are scored either by a 3 point shot, a 2 point shot or a 1 point free throw, 110 points were scored from 70 successful shots. Find all ways in which the points may have been scored in this game.}
{Let $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ represent the number of free throws, 2 point and 3 point shots taken. The augmented matrix from this system is $\bmx{cccc}1&1&1&70\\1&2&3&110 \emx$. From this we find the solution \begin{align*} x_1&=30+x_3\\ x_2&=40-2x_3.\end{align*} In order for $x_2$ to be nonnegative, we need $x_3\leq 20$. Thus there are 21 different scenerios: the ``first'' is where 0 three point shots are taken ($x_3=0$, 30 free throws and 40 two point shots; the ``last'' is where 20 three point shots are taken, 50 free throws, and no two point shots.
