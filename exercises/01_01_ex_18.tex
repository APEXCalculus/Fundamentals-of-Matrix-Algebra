{A jar contains 100 marbles. We know there are twice as many green marbles as red; that the number of blue and yellow marbles together is the same as the number of green; and that three times the number of yellow marbles together with the red marbles gives the same numbers as the blue marbles. How many of each color of marble are in the jar?}
{35 blue, 40 green, 20 red, 5 yellow}
