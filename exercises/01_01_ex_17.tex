{A carpenter can make two sizes of table, grande and venti. The grande table requires 4 table legs and 1 table top; the venti requires 6 table legs and 2 table tops. After doing work, he counts up spare parts in his warehouse and realizes that he has 86 table tops left over, and 300 legs. How many tables of each kind can he build and use up exactly all of his materials?}
{42 grande tables, 22 venti tables}
