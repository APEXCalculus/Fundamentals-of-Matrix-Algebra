This text took a great deal of effort to accomplish and I owe a great many people thanks. \\
\bigskip

I owe Michelle (and Sydney and Alex) much for their support at home. Michelle puts up with much as I continually read \LaTeX\ manuals, sketch outlines of the text, write exercises, and draw illustrations.\\

My thanks to the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Virginia Military Institute for their support of this project. Lee Dewald and Troy Siemers, my department heads, deserve special thanks for their special encouragement and recognition that this effort has been a worthwhile endeavor.\\

My thanks to all who informed me of errors in the text or provided ideas for improvement. Special thanks to Michelle Feole and Dan Joseph who each caught a number of errors.\\

This whole project would have been impossible save for the efforts of the \LaTeX\ community. This text makes use of about 15 different packages, was compiled using MiK\TeX, and edited using \TeX nicCenter, all of which was provided free of charge. This generosity helped convince me that this text should be made freely available as well.
